# HTTP/3 Temporary Squatting Module (to prevent malicious squatting for the future)

I noticed that this package name is not yet taken. After seeing the unfortunate problem with `worker` and `deno`, I've decided to do some "benign squatting", such that it could be transferred properly to the Node.js team without potential arguments. Please contact me through email ASAP once HTTP/3 is available for Node.js. (it should be available through NPM)

I also own `http3.org` for some reason, so if anyone is interested in putting up an interesting site that introduces http3 concepts or more, feel free to contact me too.
